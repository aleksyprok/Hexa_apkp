MPI potential field generator - ONLY TO BE USED WITH CLOSED TOP AND SIDE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS!!!!!!!

This code produces potential fields for each magnetogram observation used in the simulation. These potential fields allow the free magnetic energy to be calculated.

The MPI version of the code works by dividing the N magnetograms between the M processors used, and getting each processor to loop over the N/M runs and calculate each potential field in turn. 


Usage:
From the data preparation directory, copy across the 'params.dat' file and create a directory whose name matches the run name used in the data preparation routine. In this directory place the mag_data.dat file produced by the data preparation routine.

Compile the code using make. This code has been tested on gcc 4.8.3 using OpenMPI 1.6.4 and with ifort 12.1.0 using Intel MPI 4.0 update 3.



NOTE: N (the number of framess) does not need to be divisible by M (the number of processes), so if (for example) N=11 and M=2, then processor 1 will calculate frames 1:5 and processor 2 will calculate frames 6:11. 

VERY IMPORTANT:
Each process requires ~0.125/~1/~8 GB of memory for grids with resolutions of 128^3/256^3/512^3, so be careful (especially for the 512^3 grids) not to run more processes per node than the node has memory for.
