This directory contains the set of data preparation routines for cleaning up a time series of magnetograms
and producing the necessary files to allow a simulation to be run by Hexa, namely an initial condition
coronal field, the evolving lower boundary condition, and the set of run parameters.

In order to use the routines, an IDL save file (data.sav) containing the magnetogram time series in the form
of an array DATA=FLTARR(NX,NY,NT) must be placed in a directory ($DIR).




TO USE:

Type 'make' to compile the fortran codes. 

In the file 'required_info' set the variable 'dir' to the working directory ($DIR), 'deltx' to the size of a 
magnetogram pixel in centimetres and 'dtime' to the magnetogram cadence (in minutes).

Then in an IDL window, type '@Start' to initialise the routines. Then simply type 'data_prep' and follow the
onscreen instructions.


OUTPUT:


Root directory:
params.dat - parameter file used by the fortran codes


$DIR:
mag_data - fortran unformatted data file containing the cleaned magnetograms. To be used by the fortran codes

$DIR/plots:
raw_flux.eps - the time evolution of the flux in the observed magnetograms
cleaned_flux.eps - the time evolution of the flux in the cleaned manetograms
flux_imbalance.eps - the time evolution of the flux imbalance in the observed and cleaned magnetograms
separation.eps - the time evolution of the bipole separation in the observed and cleaned magnetograms
tilt_angle.eps - the time evolution of the bipole tilt angle in the observed and cleaned magnetograms
hexa_flux.eps - the time evolution of the flux in the lower boundary condition used by Hexa
hexa_sep.eps - the time evolution of the bipole separation in the lower boundary condition used by Hexa
hexa_tilt.eps - the time evolution of the bipole separation in the lower boundary condition used by Hexa
