IDL potential field generator - ONLY TO BE USED IF EITHER OPEN TOP AND/OR PERIODIC SIDE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE USED.

This code produces potential fields for each magnetogram observation used in the simulation. These potential fields allow the free magnetic energy to be calculated.


Usage:
From the data preparation directory, copy across the 'params.dat' file and create a directory whose name matches the run name used in the data preparation routine. In this directory place the mag_data.dat file produced by the data preparation routine.

Run the code in IDL to generate the potential fields.
